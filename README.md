# Algorithmic Stablecoin with Governance

## Overview

**Algorithmic Stablecoin with Governance** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that aims to address critical challenges in current stablecoin models, including depegging risks, oracle vulnerabilities, and ineffective governance. Our solution combines:

- A **Hybrid Collateral System** with diversified assets (BTC, ETH, stablecoins, decentralized LP tokens) and an Automated Stability Reserve.
- A **Dynamic Stability Mechanism** driven by real-time, AI-powered adjustments.
- **Multi-Oracle Aggregation** with cross-validation and anti-manipulation protocols.
- An **Adaptive Governance Model** that blends Quadratic and Conviction Voting, ensuring decentralization and community-driven decision-making.

This repository contains the source code and initial documentation for the MVP version of the project.
