# Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the requirements for the development of an algorithmic stablecoin with integrated governance. The goal is to deliver a decentralized financial system that addresses three critical problems:

- Depegging and Stability Risks
- Oracle Vulnerabilities & Price Manipulation
- Ineffective Governance

### 1.2 Scope

The system will include:

- A stablecoin mechanism with minting and burning capabilities.
- A hybrid collateral system with diversified assets.
- An Automated Stability Reserve to deploy capital during market volatility.
- A multi-oracle aggregation mechanism with anti-manipulation protocols.
- An adaptive governance framework using a combination of Quadratic and Conviction Voting.
- A user-friendly dApp interface for end-user interaction and governance participation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Stablecoin & Collateral System

**Mint/Burn Mechanism**

- Smart contract logic that automatically mints stablecoins when collateral increases or burns tokens when the peg is threatened.
- Real-time adjustments based on market conditions.

**Hybrid Collateral System**

- Support for diversified collateral assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, stablecoins, decentralized LP tokens).
- Integration of collateral valuation mechanisms.

**Automated Stability Reserve**

- On-chain treasury that deploys capital during extreme volatility.
- Automated triggers based on predefined stability thresholds.

### 2.2 Oracle System

**Multi-Oracle Aggregation**

- Integration with multiple oracle providers (e.g., Chainlink, Band, API3) to fetch real-time price data.

**On-chain Redundancy & Cross-Validation**

- Mechanisms to compare and validate data from different oracles.

**Anti-Manipulation Protocol**

- Statistical anomaly detection and weighted consensus methods (e.g., median calculation) to detect manipulated feeds.
- Automated isolation of any anomalous data sources.

### 2.3 Governance System

**Governance Token**

- ERC-20 based token that grants voting rights.
- Mechanisms for token distribution (e.g., staking rewards, liquidity mining).

**DAO Governance Process**

- Proposal creation, voting (blending Quadratic and Conviction Voting), and execution.
- A real-time governance dashboard for transparent tracking of proposals and votes.

**Tokenized Governance Incentives**

- Reward system to encourage active participation.
- Penalization mechanisms for vote-buying or malicious activities.

### 2.4 User Interface & Interactions

**dApp Interface**

- Wallet integration (e.g., MetaMask) for secure access.
- Functional screens for collateral deposit, minting, burning, and redemption.
- Interfaces for viewing market data, stability reserve status, and governance proposals.

**User Experience**

- Clear, intuitive navigation with real-time feedback on transactions and voting status.

### 2.5 Testing & Simulation Requirements

**Market Condition Simulations**

- Tools to simulate extreme market conditions (e.g., rapid price crashes) to validate the peg maintenance mechanism.

**Oracle Manipulation Simulations**

- Test scenarios to simulate oracle feed manipulation and validate the anti-manipulation protocols.

**Governance Scenario Testing**

- Simulated voting scenarios to ensure that the adaptive governance mechanism encourages engagement and fairness.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Security

**Smart Contract Security**

- Follow best practices (e.g., using OpenZeppelin libraries) to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and flash loan exploits.

**Threat Model Compliance**

- Implementation of mitigation strategies based on a detailed threat model (covering oracle attacks, governance manipulation, etc.).

**Audit & Penetration Testing**

- Regular internal audits and third-party security reviews.

### 3.2 Performance & Scalability

**Low Latency**

- Quick oracle data aggregation and on-chain processing to ensure timely stability adjustments.

**Scalability**

- Architecture designed to support an increasing number of users and transactions without degradation in performance.

### 3.3 Reliability & Availability

**System Uptime**

- High availability of both smart contracts and the dApp interface.

**Fault Tolerance**

- Backup and recovery plans for critical contract state and treasury data.

### 3.4 Usability & Accessibility

**User-Friendly dApp**

- Intuitive design with clear instructions and real-time feedback.

**Documentation & Support**

- Comprehensive user manuals, FAQs, and developer guides.

### 3.5 Maintainability & Extensibility

**Modular Architecture**

- Clearly defined interfaces between the stablecoin, oracle, and governance modules.

**Version Control & Change Management**

- Systematic tracking of changes and updates for continuous improvement.

**Future Enhancements**

- Design considerations for adding new collateral types, oracle sources, and governance features.

### 3.6 Compliance & Regulatory Considerations

**Legal Requirements**

- Ensure adherence to any relevant regulatory guidelines for stablecoins and decentralized financial systems.

**Transparency & Reporting**

- Mechanisms for transparent reporting to stakeholders, including audit trails for governance decisions.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

**Stability**

- The stablecoin maintains its peg under simulated extreme market conditions.

**Oracle Robustness**

- The oracle system effectively detects and neutralizes manipulated data feeds.

**Governance Effectiveness**

- The governance model demonstrates increased voter engagement and reduced centralization in test scenarios.

**User Experience**

- The dApp interface is intuitive and functions smoothly across supported platforms.

**Security**

- No critical vulnerabilities identified during internal and third-party security audits.
