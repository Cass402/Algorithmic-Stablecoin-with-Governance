# Architecture Document

## 1. Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the Algorithmic Stablecoin with Governance project. It outlines the major components, their responsibilities, and the interactions that enable the hybrid collateral system, robust oracle aggregation, and adaptive governance mechanism. The goal is to provide a clear picture of how the various modules work together to achieve stability, security, and decentralization.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

At a glance, the system is composed of several key layers:

### 2.1 Stablecoin & Collateral Layer

- **Stablecoin Contract**: Manages minting and burning of the stablecoin based on market conditions.
- **Collateral Pool**: Maintains diversified assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, stablecoins, LP tokens) to back the stablecoin.
- **Automated Stability Reserve**: Acts as an on-chain treasury that automatically deploys capital during volatility events.

### 2.2 Oracle Aggregation Layer

- **Multi-Oracle Integration**: Aggregates price data from several sources (Chainlink, Band, API3).
- **Data Cross-Validation**: Uses on-chain mechanisms to validate and reconcile oracle feeds, including anomaly detection and weighted consensus.

### 2.3 Governance Layer

- **Governance Token**: An ERC-20 token that enables participation and voting rights.
- **DAO Contract & Adaptive Governance**: Facilitates proposal submission, voting (using a mix of Quadratic and Conviction Voting), and execution of approved changes.
- **Governance Dashboard**: Provides real-time visual feedback on proposals, vote counts, and governance metrics.

### 2.4 User Interface (dApp) Layer

- **dApp Front-End**: A web application (built with Next.js) that allows users to interact with the protocol—mint/redeem stablecoins, deposit collateral, and participate in governance.
- **Wallet Integration**: Supports common wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for secure user authentication and transaction signing.

## 3. Component Interactions & Data Flow

### 3.1 Stablecoin & Collateral System

- **Minting/Burning Flow**:
  - Users deposit collateral through the dApp, triggering the stablecoin contract to mint new tokens if conditions are met.
  - In adverse market conditions, the contract burns tokens to maintain the peg, referencing real-time price data from the oracle layer.
- **Stability Reserve Activation**:
  - When volatility exceeds predefined thresholds, the Automated Stability Reserve automatically deploys capital to stabilize the system.

### 3.2 Oracle Aggregation & Price Validation

- **Data Collection**:
  - The system collects price feeds from multiple oracles.
- **Cross-Verification**:
  - On-chain logic compares the feeds using statistical methods (e.g., median or weighted consensus) to filter out anomalies.
- **Decision-Making**:
  - Validated price data is then used to adjust mint/burn operations and trigger stability reserve actions if needed.

### 3.3 Governance Process

- **Proposal Lifecycle**:
  - Community members propose changes through the DAO contract.
  - The proposal is then voted on using an adaptive mechanism that combines Quadratic and Conviction Voting.
- **Execution & Updates**:
  - Approved proposals are executed, updating parameters such as collateral ratios, interest rates, or mint/burn rates.
- **Transparency**:
  - The Governance Dashboard provides real-time insights into proposal status, vote distribution, and historical decisions.

### 3.4 User Interactions

- **Access & Navigation**:
  - The dApp offers intuitive navigation for depositing collateral, minting stablecoins, checking oracle data, and participating in governance.
- **Feedback & Notifications**:
  - Users receive real-time updates on transactions, market status, and governance outcomes, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.

## 4. Technology Stack & Tools

- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity (leveraging OpenZeppelin libraries for security and standard implementations).
- **Development & Testing Frameworks**: Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Oracles**: Integration with Chainlink, Band, API3 for multi-oracle feeds.
- **Governance**: Custom DAO implementation potentially built on top of OpenZeppelin’s Governor framework.
- **Front-End Development**: Next.js for the dApp, with wallet integration using libraries like Ethers.js.
- **Security Tools**: Slither, MythX for static analysis and vulnerability scanning.
