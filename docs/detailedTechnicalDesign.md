# Detailed Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides an in-depth technical overview of the design and implementation of an algorithmic stablecoin with an integrated governance mechanism. The aim is to create a system that not only maintains its peg through a dynamic, hybrid collateral model but also ensures security via multi-oracle data aggregation and robust on-chain governance.

### 1.2 Scope

The document covers:

- **Smart Contracts**: Stablecoin, collateral pool, automated stability reserve, oracle aggregator, and governance contracts.
- **Data Structures & Interfaces**: Detailed breakdown of internal states, functions, and inter-contract communication.
- **Security Considerations**: Threat model, countermeasures, and testing strategies.
- **Deployment & Integration**: How the contracts interact in a live environment, including user interface considerations.

## 2. System Components Overview

### 2.1 Stablecoin Contract

#### 2.1.1 Data Structures

- **State Variables**:
  - `uint256 totalSupply;` – Total stablecoins in circulation.
  - `mapping(address => uint256) balances;` – User balances.
  - `uint256 pegTarget;` – Target price (e.g., $1).
  - `uint256 collateralRatio;` – Dynamic collateral ratio based on market conditions.
- **Events**:
  - `Mint(address indexed user, uint256 amount);`
  - `Burn(address indexed user, uint256 amount);`

#### 2.1.2 Functions and Interfaces

- **Mint/Burn Functions**:
  - `function mint(uint256 collateralAmount) external returns (uint256 tokensMinted);`
    - Checks collateral deposited.
    - Verifies against oracle price data.
  - `function burn(uint256 tokenAmount) external returns (uint256 collateralReturned);`
    - Adjusts total supply and collateral ratio.
- **Peg Maintenance Functions**:
  - `function adjustPeg() external;`
    - Called by automated triggers to maintain peg using oracle inputs.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Interacts with the collateral pool contract for collateral deposits/withdrawals.
  - Calls the oracle aggregator contract to fetch current market prices.

#### 2.1.3 Interactions

- **Collateral Pool**:
  - Receives collateral deposits to back minted stablecoins.
- **Oracle Aggregation**:
  - Fetches validated market price data to determine mint/burn triggers.
- **Stability Reserve**:
  - Triggers actions (like capital deployment) when volatility exceeds thresholds.

### 2.2 Collateral Pool and Automated Stability Reserve

#### 2.2.1 Data Structures

- **Collateral Registry**:
  - `mapping(address => uint256) public collateralBalances;`
    - Tracks multiple collateral assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, stablecoins, LP tokens).
- **Reserve Variables**:
  - `uint256 stabilityReserve;` – Amount of capital in reserve.
- **Events**:
  - `CollateralDeposited(address indexed user, address token, uint256 amount);`
  - `ReserveDeployed(uint256 amount);`

#### 2.2.2 Core Logic

- **Collateral Management**:
  - Functions to deposit, withdraw, and value collateral using current market prices.
- **Reserve Activation**:
  - Automated triggers based on volatility metrics.
  - Integration with the stablecoin contract to deploy or absorb collateral dynamically.
- **Rebalancing**:
  - Logic to adjust the collateral ratio in real time as market conditions change.

### 2.3 Oracle Aggregation Module

#### 2.3.1 Integration with Multiple Oracles

- **Supported Oracles**:
  - Chainlink, Band, API3 (and possibly more in the future).
- **Data Collection**:
  - Each oracle has a dedicated interface that feeds into a common aggregator contract.

#### 2.3.2 Data Validation and Aggregation

- **Aggregation Logic**:
  - Utilizes algorithms such as median or weighted averages to determine the most accurate price.
- **Cross-Validation**:
  - Compares inputs from different oracles.
  - Applies statistical anomaly detection to flag outliers.
- **Interfaces**:
  - Exposes a function `function getValidatedPrice() external view returns (uint256 price);` for the stablecoin and collateral pool contracts.

#### 2.3.3 Anomaly Detection

- **Mechanism**:
  - Implements threshold-based and variance checks.
  - Automatically isolates data from any feed that significantly deviates from the consensus.

### 2.4 Governance and DAO Module

#### 2.4.1 Governance Token

- **ERC-20 Implementation**:
  - Standard token with additional governance functions.
  - Token distribution via staking rewards and liquidity mining.
- **State Variables**:
  - `mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;` – Tracks adjusted voting weights.

#### 2.4.2 DAO Contract & Voting Mechanisms

- **Proposal Lifecycle**:
  - **Creation**: `function proposeChange(bytes calldata proposalData) external returns (uint256 proposalId);`
  - **Voting**:
    - Combines Quadratic Voting (reduces large-token-holder influence) and Conviction Voting (weights long-term participation).
  - **Execution**:
    - Approved proposals trigger parameter updates in the stablecoin or collateral contracts.
- **Governance Dashboard Integration**:
  - Real-time visualization of active proposals, vote counts, and historical decisions.

#### 2.4.3 Tokenized Governance Incentives

- **Incentive Mechanism**:
  - Rewards active participants.
  - Penalizes vote-buying attempts or malicious behavior through reputation scoring.
- **Smart Contract Logic**:
  - Periodically recalculates voting weights based on activity and stake duration.

### 2.5 User Interface (dApp)

#### 2.5.1 Front-End Technologies

- **Framework**:
  - Built with Next.js.
- **Wallet Integration**:
  - Supports MetaMask and other Web3 wallets via libraries like Ethers.js.

#### 2.5.2 Interaction Flows

- **Minting/Burning Flow**:
  - Users deposit collateral, view current peg status, and initiate mint/burn transactions.
- **Governance Flow**:
  - Dashboard to view proposals, cast votes, and track the outcomes of governance actions.
- **Collateral Management**:
  - UI for depositing/withdrawing collateral and viewing current balances.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Integration with on-chain events to provide instant feedback on transactions and market data.

## 3. Integration Details

### 3.1 Inter-Contract Communication

- **Stablecoin ↔ Collateral Pool**:
  - Direct function calls to deposit/withdraw collateral and adjust mint/burn amounts.
- **Stablecoin ↔ Oracle Aggregator**:
  - Fetch current price data before mint/burn operations.
- **Governance ↔ Other Modules**:
  - Upon proposal approval, the DAO contract triggers parameter changes in the stablecoin, collateral pool, or oracle modules.

### 3.2 Data Flow Examples

- **Minting Process**:
  1. User deposits collateral via the dApp.
  2. Collateral Pool validates and locks the asset.
  3. Stablecoin contract requests current price data from the Oracle Aggregator.
  4. If conditions are met, stablecoin is minted and recorded.
- **Governance Process**:
  1. Proposal is created and broadcast on the DAO contract.
  2. Users vote using their governance tokens.
  3. Upon reaching the required consensus, approved changes are executed on relevant contracts.

## 4. Security and Threat Model

### 4.1 Threat Model Overview

- **Reentrancy and Overflow/Underflow**:
  - Mitigated using OpenZeppelin libraries and Solidity’s built-in checks.
- **Oracle Manipulation**:
  - Addressed by multi-oracle aggregation and statistical anomaly detection.
- **Governance Attacks**:
  - Countered through adaptive voting mechanisms and tokenized incentives.
- **Collateral and Reserve Risks**:
  - Regular rebalancing and automated stability reserve activation to handle extreme market conditions.

### 4.2 Mitigation Strategies

- **Code Audits**:
  - Conduct both internal and external audits.
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
  - Use tools like Slither, MythX, and automated test suites.
- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Implement logging and alert systems for unusual activity on critical functions.

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit and Integration Testing

- **Smart Contract Testing**:
  - Use Hardhat for unit tests covering all contract functions.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Simulate interactions between stablecoin, collateral, oracle, and governance contracts.

### 5.2 Simulation of Extreme Scenarios

- **Market Volatility Simulations**:
  - Test the mint/burn logic under simulated rapid price fluctuations.
- **Oracle Attack Simulations**:
  - Deliberately introduce manipulated oracle data to verify the anti-manipulation protocols.
- **Governance Stress Tests**:
  - Simulate high volume voting and attack scenarios to validate adaptive voting mechanics.

## 6. Deployment Strategy

### 6.1 Environment Setup

- **Testnet Deployment**:
  - Deploy contracts on a testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia, or Polygon Mumbai) for live testing.
- **Upgradeability**:
  - Use of proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin’s Upgradeable Contracts) for future updates.

### 6.2 Operational Considerations

- **Monitoring**:
  - Deploy monitoring dashboards for real-time contract activity.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Establish procedures for emergency interventions (e.g., pausing contracts in the event of a detected vulnerability).

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Expansion of Collateral Options**:
  - Integrate additional asset types and adjust valuation logic accordingly.
- **Advanced AI-Driven Adjustments**:
  - Refine the dynamic stability mechanism with more sophisticated machine learning models.
- **Enhanced User Experience**:
